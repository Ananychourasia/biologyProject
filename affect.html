    <h1>How we affect biodiversity</h1>
    <p>Humans are the reason of most of the damage to biodiversity. We are dependent on plants for our survival but over exploitation of biodiversity is wrong.</p>
    <h2>We are affecting biodiversity by- </h2>
    <h3>Overpopulation </h3>

    <p>Overpopulation is the reason of many problems. We need residence for more people for which we have to cut more trees for land. The usage of renewable as well as non-renewable resorces increases which may lead to wastage and exploitation.</p>
    <h3> Deforestation</h3>

    <p>Usually humans do deforestation for making factories, residence and other things for human comfort. Forests are home to many species of animals and by deforestation we destruct their habitats and so we are the reasons of animals getting endangered. </p>
    <h3>Exploitation</h3>
    <p>We humans are using harsh chemicals in our day to day life resulting in pollution of air and again a threat to biodiversity. Even if we are getting resources as much needed we want more, this is exploitation and is not good for anyone.    </p>

    <h2>How can we save our biodiversity</h2>
    <p>These are some points by which we can try to save our lost biodiversity</p>
    <ol>
     <li>Population control</li> 
     <li>Increase the number of seeds banks </li>
     <li>Promotion of plantation campaigns  </li>
     <li>Conservation of resources</li>
     <li>Increase of budget in wildlife securities</li>

    </ol>
